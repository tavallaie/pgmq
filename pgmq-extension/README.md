## Features

- Lightweight - No background worker or external dependencies, just Postgres functions packaged in an extension
- Guaranteed "exactly once" delivery of messages to a consumer within a visibility timeout
- API parity with [AWS SQS](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) and [RSMQ](https://github.com/smrchy/rsmq)
- Messages stay in the queue until explicitly removed
- Messages can be archived, instead of deleted, for long-term retention and replayability

Supported on Postgres 14-17.

## Installation

The fastest way to get started is by running the Docker image, where PGMQ comes pre-installed in Postgres.

```bash
docker run -d --name pgmq-postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres -p 5432:5432 ghcr.io/pgmq/pg17-pgmq:v1.5.1
```

If you'd like to install PGMQ into an existing Postgres instance, refer to [INSTALLATION.md](https://github.com/pgmq/pgmq/blob/main/INSTALLATION.md).

## SQL Examples

```bash
# Connect to Postgres
psql postgres://postgres:postgres@0.0.0.0:5432/postgres
```

```sql
-- create the extension in the "pgmq" schema
CREATE EXTENSION pgmq;
```

### Creating a queue

Every queue is its own table in the `pgmq` schema. The table name is the queue name prefixed with `q_`.
For example, `pgmq.q_my_queue` is the table for the queue `my_queue`.

```sql
-- creates the queue
SELECT pgmq.create('my_queue');
```

```text
 create
-------------

(1 row)
```

### Send two messages

```sql
-- messages are sent as JSON
SELECT * from pgmq.send(
  queue_name  => 'my_queue',
  msg         => '{"foo": "bar1"}'
);
```

The message id is returned from the send function.

```text
 send
-----------
         1
(1 row)
```

```sql
-- Optionally provide a delay
-- this message will be on the queue but unable to be consumed for 5 seconds
SELECT * from pgmq.send(
  queue_name => 'my_queue',
  msg        => '{"foo": "bar2"}',
  delay      => 5
);
```

```text
 send
-----------
         2
(1 row)
```

### Read messages

Read `2` message from the queue. Make them invisible for `30` seconds.
If the messages are not deleted or archived within 30 seconds, they will become visible again
and can be read by another consumer.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pgmq.read(
  queue_name => 'my_queue',
  vt         => 30,
  qty        => 2
);
```

```text
 msg_id | read_ct |          enqueued_at          |              vt               |     message
--------+---------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+-----------------
      1 |       1 | 2023-08-16 08:37:54.567283-05 | 2023-08-16 08:38:29.989841-05 | {"foo": "bar1"}
      2 |       1 | 2023-08-16 08:37:54.572933-05 | 2023-08-16 08:38:29.989841-05 | {"foo": "bar2"}
```

If the queue is empty, or if all messages are currently invisible, no rows will be returned.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pgmq.read(
  queue_name => 'my_queue',
  vt         => 30,
  qty        => 1
);
```

```text
 msg_id | read_ct | enqueued_at | vt | message
--------+---------+-------------+----+---------
```

### Pop a message

```sql
-- Read a message and immediately delete it from the queue. Returns an empty record if the queue is empty or all messages are invisible.
SELECT * FROM pgmq.pop('my_queue');
```

```text
 msg_id | read_ct |          enqueued_at          |              vt               |     message
--------+---------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+-----------------
      1 |       1 | 2023-08-16 08:37:54.567283-05 | 2023-08-16 08:38:29.989841-05 | {"foo": "bar1"}
```

### Archive a message

Archiving a message removes it from the queue and inserts it to the archive table.

```sql
-- Archive message with msg_id=2.
SELECT pgmq.archive(
  queue_name => 'my_queue',
  msg_id     => 2
);
```

```text
 archive
--------------
 t
(1 row)
```

Or archive several messages in one operation using `msg_ids` (plural) parameter:

First, send a batch of messages

```sql
SELECT pgmq.send_batch(
  queue_name => 'my_queue',
  msgs       => ARRAY['{"foo": "bar3"}','{"foo": "bar4"}','{"foo": "bar5"}']::jsonb[]
);
```

```text
 send_batch 
------------
          3
          4
          5
(3 rows)
```

Then archive them by using the msg_ids (plural) parameter.

```sql
SELECT pgmq.archive(
  queue_name => 'my_queue',
  msg_ids    => ARRAY[3, 4, 5]
);
```

```text
 archive 
---------
       3
       4
       5
(3 rows)
```

Archive tables can be inspected directly with SQL.
 Archive tables have the prefix `a_` in the `pgmq` schema.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pgmq.a_my_queue;
```

```text
 msg_id | read_ct |          enqueued_at          |          archived_at          |              vt               |     message     
--------+---------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+-----------------
      2 |       0 | 2024-08-06 16:03:41.531556+00 | 2024-08-06 16:03:52.811063+00 | 2024-08-06 16:03:46.532246+00 | {"foo": "bar2"}
      3 |       0 | 2024-08-06 16:03:58.586444+00 | 2024-08-06 16:04:02.85799+00  | 2024-08-06 16:03:58.587272+00 | {"foo": "bar3"}
      4 |       0 | 2024-08-06 16:03:58.586444+00 | 2024-08-06 16:04:02.85799+00  | 2024-08-06 16:03:58.587508+00 | {"foo": "bar4"}
      5 |       0 | 2024-08-06 16:03:58.586444+00 | 2024-08-06 16:04:02.85799+00  | 2024-08-06 16:03:58.587543+00 | {"foo": "bar5"}
```

### Delete a message

Send another message, so that we can delete it.

```sql
SELECT pgmq.send('my_queue', '{"foo": "bar6"}');
```

```text
 send
-----------
        6
(1 row)
```

Delete the message with id `6` from the queue named `my_queue`.

```sql
SELECT pgmq.delete('my_queue', 6);
```

```text
 delete
-------------
 t
(1 row)
```

### Drop a queue

Delete the queue `my_queue`.

```sql
SELECT pgmq.drop_queue('my_queue');
```

```text
 drop_queue
-----------------
 t
(1 row)
```

## Configuration

### Partitioned Queues

You will need to install [pg_partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman/) if you want to use `pgmq` partitioned queues.

`pgmq` queue tables can be created as a partitioned table by using `pgmq.create_partitioned()`. [pg_partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman/)
handles all maintenance of queue tables. This includes creating new partitions and dropping old partitions.

Partitions behavior is configured at the time queues are created, via `pgmq.create_partitioned()`. This function has three parameters:

`queue_name: text`: The name of the queue. Queues are Postgres tables prepended with `q_`. For example, `q_my_queue`. The archive is instead prefixed by `a_`, for example `a_my_queue`.

`partition_interval: text` - The interval at which partitions are created. This can be either any valid Postgres `Duration` supported by pg_partman, or an integer value. When it is a duration, queues are partitioned by the time at which messages are sent to the table (`enqueued_at`). A value of `'daily'` would create a new partition each day. When it is an integer value, queues are partitioned by the `msg_id`. A value of `'100'` will create a new partition every 100 messages. The value must agree with `retention_interval` (time based or numeric). The default value is `daily`. For archive table, when interval is an integer value, then it will be partitioned by `msg_id`. In case of duration it will be partitioned on `archived_at` unlike queue table.

`retention_interval: text` - The interval for retaining partitions. This can be either any valid Postgres `Duration` supported by pg_partman, or an integer value. When it is a duration, partitions containing data greater than the duration will be dropped. When it is an integer value, any messages that have a `msg_id` less than `max(msg_id) - retention_interval` will be dropped. For example, if the max `msg_id` is 100 and the `retention_interval` is 60, any partitions with `msg_id` values less than 40 will be dropped. The value must agree with `partition_interval` (time based or numeric). The default is `'5 days'`. Note: `retention_interval` does not apply to messages that have been deleted via `pgmq.delete()` or archived with `pgmq.archive()`. `pgmq.delete()` removes messages forever and `pgmq.archive()` moves messages to the corresponding archive table forever (for example, `a_my_queue`).

In order for automatic partition maintenance to take place, several settings must be added to the `postgresql.conf` file, which is typically located in the postgres `DATADIR`.
`pg_partman_bgw.interval`
in `postgresql.conf`. Below are the default configuration values set in pgmq docker images.

Add the following to `postgresql.conf`. Note, changing `shared_preload_libraries` requires a restart of Postgres.

`pg_partman_bgw.interval` sets the interval at which `pg_partman` conducts maintenance. This creates new partitions and dropping of partitions falling out of the `retention_interval`. By default, `pg_partman` will keep 4 partitions "ahead" of the currently active partition.

```text
shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_partman_bgw' # requires restart of Postgres
pg_partman_bgw.interval = 60
pg_partman_bgw.role = 'postgres'
pg_partman_bgw.dbname = 'postgres'
```

## Visibility Timeout (vt)

pgmq guarantees exactly once delivery of a message within a visibility timeout. The visibility timeout is the amount of time a message is invisible to other consumers after it has been read by a consumer. If the message is NOT deleted or archived within the visibility timeout, it will become visible again and can be read by another consumer. The visibility timeout is set when a message is read from the queue, via `pgmq.read()`. It is recommended to set a `vt` value that is greater than the expected time it takes to process a message. After the application successfully processes the message, it should call `pgmq.delete()` to completely remove the message from the queue or `pgmq.archive()` to move it to the archive table for the queue.
